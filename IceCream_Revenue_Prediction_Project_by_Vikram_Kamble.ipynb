    "Hey! So this is a small project I made where I tried to predict ice cream revenue based on temperature. I was just messing around with some machine learning stuff and thought this would be a fun and simple idea to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I did:\n",
    "- Got some basic data about temperature and how much ice cream was sold.\n",
    "- Used Python and some ML libraries (like pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn).\n",
    "- Cleaned up the data, did some plotting to see how things looked.\n",
    "- Then I trained a linear regression model to predict revenue from temperature.\n",
    "- Checked how well it worked using accuracy scores and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools I used:\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn\n",
    "- sklearn (for training the model)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I did this:\n",
    "Honestly, I just wanted to get more comfortable with ML basics. Regression is like one of the first things you learn, so this was good practice for me. Plus, I like ice cream üòÑ\n",

    "If you're starting out with machine learning, this kind of small project is a great way to get hands-on. It‚Äôs super simple and actually kinda fun.\n"
