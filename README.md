# 🍦 icecream-revenue-prediction

A beginner-friendly machine learning project to predict ice cream sales based on temperature data.

This small project helped me practice basic data handling, visualization, and linear regression using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The idea is simple: when it gets hotter, people buy more ice cream.  
So, using some sample data of temperatures and ice cream sales, I built a model to predict revenue from temperature.

This is a small project, mainly to practice and understand:
- Data preprocessing
- Visualization
- Model training and testing

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 What I Did

- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Visualized the data to see the trend
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score and plots

## 💡 Why This Project?

I just wanted to get better at the basics of machine learning.  
Regression is one of the first things you learn, so I wanted to try it on a real-ish example.  
And well, I like ice cream 😄
